    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>During my adventure on the front-end I have tried to dive into many technologies. I belive in philosophy of learning by doing so to discover how some technology works I have always try to prepare some simple project.</p>
    <p>Below you can see some examples of my learning by doing.</p>

    <ul *ngIf="projects.length > 0 && isDownloading === false">
        <li *ngFor="let project of projects">
            <app-project [project]="project"></app-project>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <app-loader *ngIf="isDownloading === true"></app-loader>
